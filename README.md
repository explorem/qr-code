## My process

In this project, I improved my ability to center objects on the website. I also improved the cleanliness of HTML and CSS code. I also used semantic HTML5 tags.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned how to center an object with a flexbox.

``` css
.proud-of-this-css:

body {width: 100%;
    min-height: 100vh;
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: column;
    justify-content: center;
    align-items: center;
    }
```
### Continued development

I will still learn. The next step will be advanced CSS functions related to flexbox and grid.
